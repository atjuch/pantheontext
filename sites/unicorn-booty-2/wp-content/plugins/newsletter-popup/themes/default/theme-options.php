 * This is a pre packaged theme options page. Every option name
 * must start with "theme_" so Newsletter can distinguish them from other
 * options that are specific to the object using the theme.
 *
 * An array of theme default options should always be present and that default options
 * should be merged with the current complete set of options as shown below.
 *
 * Every theme can define its own set of options, the will be used in the theme.php
 * file while composing the email body. Newsletter knows nothing about theme options
 * (other than saving them) and does not use or relies on any of them.
 *
 * For multilanguage purpose you can actually check the constants "WP_LANG", until
 * a decent system will be implemented.
